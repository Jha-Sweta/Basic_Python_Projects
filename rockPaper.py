"""
Project: Rock Paper Scissors
Instructions
Make a rock, paper, scissors game.

Inside the main.py file, you'll find the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a 
corresponding variable: rock, paper, and scissors. 
This will make it easy to print them out to the console.

Start the game by asking the player:

"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."

From there you will need to figure out:

How you will store the user's input.
How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
And also how you will give feedback to the player.
